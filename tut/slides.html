# the agenda

1. _Brief_ intro to shapeless
2. Dive into examples
  - list combinations
  - repeating-effects
  - ~~values of enum-like ADT~~ (oops 20 minute talk...)

_Not_ an in-depth explanation of shapeless. See [resources](#resources).

???

Poll the audience on whether they are familiar with shapeless.

There have been a number of great in-depth explanations of shapeless. Today I am going to take a different approach and show a few cool things that it can do, and maybe it will pique your curiosity or prompt you to consider shapeless for uses that you wouldn't have.

# about me

<img style="float: right" alt="our cat, Kito, helps me with a pull request review" src="./kito-helps-with-pr-review.jpg" />

Cody Allen

- scala developer ~6 years
- OSS contributor (mostly with [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/))
- pair programmer (mostly with cats)
- machine learning and natural language processing at Salesforce
- I didn't understand shapeless the first time that I looked at it.

???

I think that it's worth calling out that I didn't understand shapeless the first time that I looked at it. It's a pretty abstract library, and I thought that it seemed like it was probably doing cool things, but I didn't have a good feel for how I would actually use it. It wasn't until about a year later when I had a good concrete use-case for shapeless that it started to click for me. So if you have looked at shapeless and had a hard time wrapping your head around it, don't worry about it.

---

# shapeless

From the README:

> shapeless is a type class and dependent type based generic programming library for Scala.

--

<br />

A little abstract? That's okay we'll look at some examples.

---

# shapeless

Libraries using shapeless:

- [doobie](https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie) - JDBC
- [scodec](https://github.com/scodec/scodec) - binary data
- [circe](https://github.com/circe/circe) - JSON
- [Frameless](https://github.com/typelevel/frameless) - Spark
- [refined](https://github.com/fthomas/refined) - refined types
- [PureConfig](https://github.com/pureconfig/pureconfig) - reading config
- ... and many more

???

These libraries use shapeless for its powerful abstractions to work with types that are known by the library author at compile time (but not to shapeless).

When people tell me that they haven't been able to wrap their head around shapeless, I often say something like "it tends to be more useful for library developers than application developers." While I think that this is generally true, in this presentation I want to talk about some one-off use cases where I reached for it.

# labeling emails

_What's your availability on Wednesday afternoon?_

Is the sender of this email trying to schedule a meeting?

--

- judge a: yes
- judge b: yes
- judge c: no
- judge d: yes

--

Pairwise agreement:

- (a, b): 74%
- (a, c): 52%
- (a, d): 87%
- (b, c): 61%
- (b, d): 78%
- (c, d): 63%

---

# pairs of list elements

```tut:silent
def pairs[A](l: List[A]): List[(A, A)] = for {
  (a1, id1) <- l.zipWithIndex
  (a2, id2) <- l.zipWithIndex
  if id1 < id2
} yield (a1, a2)

val names = List("a", "b", "c", "d")
```

```tut:book
pairs(names)
```

.footer.center[`pairs` based on [this stack overflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45725255)]

???

Checking agreement rates among groups of data labelers.

Step 1: enumerate groups that we want to check.

---

# standard library combinations

```tut:book
names.combinations(2).toList

names.combinations(3).toList
```

Works with an arbitrary value of `n` instead of just `2`.

--

But, it gives us a `List` of `List`s, throwing away information about what `n` was.

--

Can we do better?

---

# literal values

The scala compiler has unique types for literal values.

```tut:book
// int return type for runtime value
final val cores = Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors()

// literal Int(3) return type for literal value
final val three = 3
```

--

Shapeless provides support for using these literal value types.

---

# shapeless-powered combinations implementation

```tut:silent
import shapeless.Nat
import shapeless.ops.nat._
import shapeless.ops.traversable.ToSizedHList
import scala.collection._

def combos[F[T] <: GenTraversable[T], A, N <: Nat, Out](n: Nat, l: F[A])(implicit
  toInt: ToInt[n.N], ev0: F[A] <:< SeqLike[A, F[A]],
  toHList: ToSizedHList.Aux[F, A, n.N, Option[Out]]
): Iterator[Out] =
  l.combinations(toInt()).map(toHList(_).getOrElse(sys.error("This shouldn't happen...")))
```

Note: this definition will be [slightly cleaner](https://github.com/milessabin/shapeless/pull/816) after the next shapeless release.

???

The actual definition isn't that important. The main thing to note is that other than wrangling some implicits, the actual implementation is a single line.

---

# shapeless-powered combinations usage

```tut:book
combos(2, names).toList.map(_.tupled)
combos(3, names).toList.map(_.tupled)
combos(4, names).toList.map(_.tupled)
```

---

# awaiting messages

This came up while working on a websocket-based protocol.

```tut:silent
import scala.concurrent.duration.DurationInt
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext
import cats.effect.IO
import cats.implicits._

implicit val timer = IO.timer(ExecutionContext.global)

// mock implementation of awaiting a message
val awaitMsg: IO[String] =
  IO.sleep(1 millis) *> IO{System.currentTimeMillis().toString}
```

```tut:book
awaitMsg.unsafeRunSync
```

---

# multiple messages in the protocol

This protocol requires that we await 2 messages...

```tut:book
val await2 = for {
  msg1 <- awaitMsg
  msg2 <- awaitMsg
} yield (msg1, msg2)

await2.unsafeRunSync
```

---

# 3 messages in the protocol

Oh now 3...

```tut:book
val await3 = for {
  msg1 <- awaitMsg
  msg2 <- awaitMsg
  msg3 <- awaitMsg
} yield (msg1, msg2, msg3)

await3.unsafeRunSync
```

---

# alternative syntax for awaiting 3 messages

```tut:book
val await3 = awaitMsg product awaitMsg product awaitMsg
await3.unsafeRunSync
```

```tut:book
val await3 = (awaitMsg, awaitMsg, awaitMsg).tupled
await3.unsafeRunSync
```

--

Can we do better?

???

If we continue the pattern of using `product`, it gets pretty verbose and we get this awkward nested tuple as a return type.

It's not too bad if we use Cat's `.tupled` syntax. But we still have to type `awaitMsg` 3 times. Is there a better way?

---

# replicateA

`replicateA`: apply an effect `n` times and collect the results in a `List`.

Available for all types that form an [applicative functor](https://typelevel.org/cats/typeclasses/applicative.html)

```tut:book
val await2 = awaitMsg.replicateA(2)
await2.unsafeRunSync

val await3 = awaitMsg.replicateA(3)
await3.unsafeRunSync
```

???

This is nice. It will generalize to an arbitrary `n` value, and it works for lots of types; not just `IO`.

But we are getting back a `List` instead of an appropriately-sized tuple. This is feeling familiar to combinations....

---

# replicateH

[replicateH](https://github.com/typelevel/kittens/blob/master/core/src/main/scala/cats/replicateH/replicateH.scala) from [kittens][kittens]

```tut:silent
import cats.replicateH._
```

```tut:book
val await2 = awaitMsg.replicateH(2).map(_.tupled)
await2.unsafeRunSync

val await3 = awaitMsg.replicateH(3).map(_.tupled)
await3.unsafeRunSync
```

---

# replicateA on List

```tut:book
val replicated2 = List(1, 2).replicateH(2).map(_.tupled)

val replicated3 = List(1, 2).replicateH(3).map(_.tupled)

replicated3.mkString("\n")
```

Similar to `combos` but pairs an element with itself too

---

# getAndIncrement with State

```tut:silent
import cats.data.State

val getAndIncrement: State[Int, Int] = State(acc => (acc + 1, acc))
```

```tut:book
getAndIncrement.run(0).value
```

---

# replicateH with State

```tut:silent
val getAndIncrement2: State[Int, (Int, Int)] =
  getAndIncrement.replicateH(2).map(_.tupled)

val getAndIncrement3: State[Int, (Int, Int, Int)] =
  getAndIncrement.replicateH(3).map(_.tupled)

val getAndIncrement4: State[Int, (Int, Int, Int, Int)] =
  getAndIncrement.replicateH(4).map(_.tupled)
```

```tut:book
getAndIncrement2.run(0).value
getAndIncrement3.run(0).value
getAndIncrement4.run(0).value
```

---

# parsing 3 letters in a row

Using the [atto](https://github.com/tpolecat/atto) parsing library

```tut:silent
import atto._, Atto._
```

```tut:book
val pMany = letter.manyN(3)

pMany.parseOnly("abc")
```

--

```tut:book
val pSquiggly = letter ~ letter ~ letter

pSquiggly.parseOnly("abc")
```

---

# replicateH on a parser

```tut:book
val pReplicate = letter.replicateH(3).map(_.tupled)

pReplicate.parseOnly("abc")
```

# replicateH implementation

# take-away lessons

Trying to wrap your head around shapeless without a concrete use-case may be tough.

--

If you find yourself throwing away information that's known at compile-time, you may have a use-case for shapeless.

--

The types and implicits might become noisy, but the implementations are often trivial.

# enums
```tut:silent
object EnumExample {
  object Comparison extends Enumeration {
    val GreaterThan, LessThan, EqualTo = Value
  }

  def toInt(c: Comparison.Value): Int = c match {
    case Comparison.GreaterThan => 1
    case Comparison.LessThan => -1
  }
}
```

--

```tut:book

EnumExample.Comparison.withName("GreaterThan")
```

---

# enums

```tut:book:fail
{
 import EnumExample._, Comparison._

 toInt(EqualTo)
}
```

`Enumeration` has its [problems][underscore-scala-enumerations-blog-post].

---
# ADT approach to enums

Cats uses an ADT for [Comparison](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/v1.4.0/kernel/src/main/scala/cats/kernel/Comparison.scala#L3-L9).

---

# enums

shapeless-powered support getting the values of an ADT "enum":

```tut:silent
object derivation {
  import shapeless.{Coproduct, Generic}
  import shapeless.ops.coproduct.Reify

  trait CaseObjects[A] {
    type Values
    def hlist: Values
  }

  object CaseObjects {
    type Aux[A, V] = CaseObjects[A] { type Values = V }

    def apply[A](implicit ev: CaseObjects[A]): Aux[A, ev.Values] =
      ev

    implicit def mkCaseObjects[A, C <: Coproduct](
        implicit gen: Generic.Aux[A, C], reify: Reify[C]): Aux[A, reify.Out] =
      new CaseObjects[A] {
        type Values = reify.Out
        def hlist: Values = reify()
      }
  }
}
```

---

# ADT enums

Let's try this out with [Comparison](https://github.com/typelevel/cats/blob/v1.4.0/kernel/src/main/scala/cats/kernel/Comparison.scala#L3-L9) from Cats.

```tut:silent
import derivation.CaseObjects
import cats.kernel.Comparison
```

```tut:book
val comparisons = CaseObjects[Comparison].hlist

comparisons.toList

val strToComparison: Map[String, Comparison] =
  comparisons.toList.map(c => c.toString -> c).toMap
```

---

# tuples

```tut:book
val t3 = (3, true, "foo")
```

--
Now let's prepend a `Double`:

```tut:silent
def prependT3[A, B, C, D](head: A, tail: (B, C, D)): (A, B, C, D) = ???
```

--

```tut:silent
def prependT3[A, B, C, D](head: A, tail: (B, C, D)): (A, B, C, D) = (head, tail._1, tail._2, tail._3)
```

```tut:book
val t4: (Double, Int, Boolean, String) = prependT3(3.14, t3)
```

---

# tuple summary

- known static size at compile time
- heterogeneous entry types (statically known at compile time)
- awkward to compose
  - `Tuple3` and `Tuple4` are completely different types with no connection
  - lacking abstraction over arity

---

# List

```tut:book
val l = List(1, 2, 3)

val l2 = 0 :: l
```

Prepending is easy!

--

What about heterogeneous lists?

```tut:book
val hl = 3 :: true :: "foo" :: Nil

val hl2 = 3.14 :: hl
```

---

# List summary

- dynamic size (unknown at compile time)
- homogeneous static entry type
  - You can shove different object types into a `List[Any]`, but you throw away type information
- easily compose (via prepend, etc)
- abstract over arity

---

# another look at List

```tut:silent
object ListDef {
  sealed abstract class List[+A]
  case object Nil extends List[Nothing]
  final case class ::[A](head: A, tail: List[A]) extends List[A]
}
```

--

`tail: List[A]` forces homogeneity. What if we use another type parameter to `::`?

---

# HList

```tut:silent
object HListDef {
  sealed abstract class HList
  case object Nil extends HList
  final case class ::[A, T](head: A, tail: T) extends HList
}
```

???

This is roughly the definition of `HList`. The actual implementation is slightly different to make this easier to work with.

---

# HList

```tut:silent
import shapeless.HNil
```

```tut:book
val h = 3 :: true :: "foo" :: HNil

h.reverse

h(2)
```

--
```tut:book:fail
h(3)
```

---

# HList summary

The type safety of tuples with the composability of lists.

- heterogeneous entry types (statically known at compile time)
- composable (via prepend, etc)
- known static size at compile time
--

  - good, but limits ability to use for dynamically-sized data
  - doobie database result set: a `Stream` of `HList`s
    - `HList`: good fit for a row, but not for a result iterator

---

# Nat

type-level natural numbers

```tut:book
val four = Nat(4)
val five = Nat(5)
val six = Nat(6)
```

---

# Nat

```tut:book
val gcdSixFive = GCD[six.N, five.N]
Nat.toInt[gcdSixFive.Out]

val gcdSixFour = GCD[six.N, four.N]
Nat.toInt[gcdSixFour.Out]
```
